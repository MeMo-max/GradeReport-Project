# GradeReport-Project
First C++ Project
Solo Programming Project Specification 	Class Grade Report 	C++ Project 
 
Standard Project Requirements: 
1.	Must use the Project Plan Template for all submissions 
2.	Program must contain individual Functions and a Main Program. 
3.	Algorithms must be included for each of the functions, as well as the main program. 
4.	All data structures (arrays, vectors, tables) must be specified. 
5.	Using OOP Classes highly encouraged.   
6.	All Code are required to have headers sections and coding comments throughout. 
7.	All Programs must be tested and documented for completeness. 
8.	The Cpp Source (*.cpp/*.h)  files must be included with the Code submission. 
9.	If used all additional input file must be included in the Code Submission.  Given input files are not required. 
Class Grade Report – Project Specifications: 
1.	Program allows the client to choose a class data text file to read in to create the Class Grade Report.  You can set an existing file as default. 
2.	Program must read in the data from the text file, which includes:    
•	Student first name 
•	Student last name 
•	Four Test Grades 
•	Final Test Grade 
3.	A class may have at max 30 students. 
4.	Two class data text files have been attached with this specification.  These files must work with your program.  [ CIT1325.txt, CIT1350.txt ]. 
5.	The students’ test grades should be kept in an array.   
6.	All the student information should be read into the program first, so you must decide how you will store the information. 
7.	Once you have the data, then calculate each student’s average (4 tests plus Final counts double).     
8.	Also calculate the student letter grade for the class based on their average.   
9.	The output of this program is a tabular grade report that is written to an output file (GradeReport.txt).   
10.	The report includes each student’s name 5 test grades, test average and final grade as a table. 
11.	At the end of the report,  print the averages of each Test and overall Test Average, as well as highest Test Grade of all Tests. 
12.	Also print  the student(s) with the highest class grade.

Some suggestion for Classes: 
1.	Student   -- data and functions associated with 1 student – name and grades 
2.	GradeReport  --  data and functions needed to create the grade report, which contains an array of students. 
Some suggestion for Functions – mostly if classes not used: 
1.	Function to read in name and grades for each student from file. 
2.	Function to calculate one student grade average. 
3.	Function to calculate letter grade for 1 student 
4.	Function to calculate the averages of 1 test 
5.	Function to calculate the overall Test Average 
6.	Function to find student with highest class grade. 7. Function to output the class grade report to a file. 
 
  
Required for PP1-Design Submission: 
1.	Completed Choice and Design in the Project Plan Document  
2.	All the algorithms must be included in the Project Plan Document and not separate files. 
Required for PP1-Code Submission: 
1.	Completed Project Plan Document 
2.	Source Code files (*.cpp / *.h files) 
3.	Additional Input files 
Required for PP1-Git Submission: 
1.	Create a personal GitHub Account 
2.	Research how to add your own code and documentation to your account 
3.	Once you have uploaded your code, then take screen shots of your code on GitHub and submit the screen-shot for credit for the assignment,
